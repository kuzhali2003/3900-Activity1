                     I am working as a <em>AEF Configuration Engineer</em> in an Insurance Company. This is an entry-level IT job. I live in Omaha for 8 years with my family. I have 8 months of application entry framework configuration experience in this job. Before this job, I worked as an Insert operator in First Data. I would like to improve my skills So,learning python would be helpful to contribute more to my job. I did my Bachelor's in Physics and MS.IT in India 18 years ago. Yes! Its been a long gap. But I'm back again! My <strong>long-time goal</strong> is to study <em>MIS in UNO.</em>
