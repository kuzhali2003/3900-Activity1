    I am working as a AEF Configuration Engineer in an Insurance Company. This is an entry level IT job. I live in Omaha for 8 years with my family. I have 8 months of application entry framework configuration experience in this job. Before this job I worked as an Insert operator in First Data. I would like to contribute more to this job. Learning python would be more helpful for me to expertise in this level. I did my Bachelors in Physics and Masters in Information Technology in India. My long-time goal is to study MIS in UNO.
